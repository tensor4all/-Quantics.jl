This library provides a high-level interface to manipulate quantics tensor train (QTT) format in Julia such as Fourier transform, convolution, and matrix-vector multiplication.
This library is based on `ITensors.jl`.

## Installation

The following will install `Quantics.jl`:

```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("Quantics.jl")
```

## Usage
